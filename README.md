 <summary><h3>✨My Journey to Excellence✨</h3></summary>
My programming journey started at the age of 8 when I received my first computer as a gift from my grandfather. I was instantly captivated by the possibilities it held. 
Over the years, my initial computer became outdated, but my passion for technology only grew stronger. In the middle school I bought myself a new computer and my curiosity turned into an unstoppable passion for programming.
I had a straightforward approach to learning. An idea would spark, and I would dive in with little knowledge, learning from the ground up. I never settled for copying code; I aimed to understand every line.
I believed it wasn't enough to get things done; understanding how they worked was crucial. This principle carries me through college, where I prioritize grasping fundamental concepts in mathematics over just problem-solving.
As my professional journey begins, my unwavering belief in my ability to learn and understand remains. Even if at first I'm not competent enough, I won't rest until I've mastered what I encounter.
This journey has shaped my love for programming, dedication to continuous learning, and commitment to understanding the digital world.
