 <summary><h3>✨My Journey to Excellence✨h3></summary>
My programming journey started at the age of 8 when I received my first computer as a gift from my grandfather on my First Holy Communion. I was instantly captivated by the possibilities it held. 
Over the years, my initial computer became outdated, but my passion for technology only grew stronger. In middle school, my curiosity turned into an unstoppable passion for programming.
I had a straightforward approach to learning. An idea would spark, and I would dive in with little knowledge, learning from the ground up. I never settled for copying code; I aimed to understand every line.
I believed it wasn't enough to get things done; understanding how they worked was crucial. This principle carries me through college, where I prioritize grasping fundamental concepts over just problem-solving.
As my professional journey begins, my unwavering belief in my ability to learn and understand remains. Even if at first I'm not competent enough, I won't rest until I've mastered what I encounter.
This journey has shaped my love for programming, dedication to continuous learning, and commitment to understanding the digital world.
